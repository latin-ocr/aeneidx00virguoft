The 'tutorial Series consists of Text-Books and Guides specially
written to meet the requirements of the various London University
Examinations by Tutors of UNIVEBSITY CORRESPONDENCF. COLLEGE.

All Latin and Greek Classics prescribed for· London University are
translated in the Tutorz‘al Series, and also edited if no thoroughly
suitable commentary has already been issued. Vocabularies in order
of the Text are prepared for Matricujation and Intermediate Arts.

The expense involved in purchasing‚ for the studv of short periods
of Historv and Literature, a large book which often contains a few
pages only of relevant matter is obviated by the issue of works
spec-ian}⁷ written for the purposes of the ExaminatIOn. Such works
are provided in the Tutrsrial Series for each Intermediate Arts
Exaniination, and also for B.A. whenever there 13 3 distinct want.

In fine, the Tuto-rial Series fills the gap which students seeking
editions of the special subjecte prescribed by London University wil}
find existing in current literature.
