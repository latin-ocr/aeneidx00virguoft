in person. He spent ten years of labour upon it, and when
he died it was still, he said, unfinished, and he bade it be
burnt. His order was not carried out. Plotius and Tucca,
two of his poet-friends, edited the work3 and there are few
signs of laek of finish in it, unless the incomplete lines be
thought to show it. Several occur in each book ; but some
are undoubtedly left incomplete on purpose to break the
continuity, and for the sake sometimes of effect.

ξ 6. The name “ epio '² signifies a long poem on a theme
dealing with human destinies on a large scale, and generally

mOdels' Homer, was continued by many others who
used the Troj an and Theban Cyeles‚ reappeared in Alexandria
in the third century Bo, and was only introduced into
Rome by Livius Andronicus about B.C. 240, who translated
the Odyssegs. After him Ennius (b. Ro. 239) wrote
eighteen books of Annales in hexameters, a versified history
of Rome. His verse was exeeedingly rude and unpolished,
but Vergil borrowed many expressions and thoughts from
him. There was no other great epio writer until Vergil’s
time, but meanwhile poets were improving the hexameter
and growing familiar with it by long use. Lucillus used
it for Satires, and Lucretius for the didactie poetry of
Philosophy. Both were in a measure models to Vergil,
Lucretius in a very large degree. But Homer was, above
all others, the one model. The imitations or adaptations
from that poet are innumerable 3 but it was a time when
borrowing was thought an essential‚ and when the readers
read new poems rather to find out how much reminiscence
of other authors there might be in the new work than
expecting new thoughts or* subjects. Still the subject of
the Aeneid is in the main original, for it is an Italian epic,
and up to that date there had been no such thing in Rome.

ξ 7. The following may be mentioned as a few of the
most striking points of Vergil's style. He avoids
f the use of prepositions, and makes wide use of
the cases, turning them to many purposes not
recognised in the prose of his time, but probably in great
