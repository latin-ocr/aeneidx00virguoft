NOTES. 33

154. ferit: “ratifies,'' because treaties were ratified by the saeri-
ficing (ferire) of a pig. libera fati: ‘⁶ set free of fate.” i.e. “left
free by destiny to take such a course.'’ For this Greek use of the geni-
tive, see S. G. ξ 284, and note on v. 326.

155. gens Lydia: cp. Lydorum, ΙΧ., 11; IndeX, av. Etrnsens.
Lydia is here the adjective, not the proper noun. Dirum, ep. v, 2, η.

156. The hiatus in the 4th foot is helped here by the full stop at
duci, cp. vv. 136, 141.

157. prima: “the first place.” Substantival accusative plural.
subiuncta leones: the accusative leona-5 is retained as the direct
object after subiuncta, the passive of a transitive verb which governs
an accusative in the active, and is an imitation of a similar Greek
idiom, though it closely beiders on and in fact runs into the use of
the accusative of extent. Cp. Horace, laevo suspensi luculos tabu-
lamque lacerto, ·‘ (boys) with satchel and writing-tablet hanging from
their left shoulder.’' This use must be distinguished from such phrases
as scissa emnam, aecinqitur ensem, which correspond to the regular
use of the Greek middle verb with a direct object, “tearing her
hair,’' “he girds a sword upon himself.⁷' Rostro is dative after the
verb compounded with sub, S. G. ξ 292.

158. Ida: not “the mountain, but the nymph mentioned also in
ΙΧ., 177. Her image stood above the beak (stem) of the vessel, and
beneath it was carved a pair of lions. ᾖ

161. quaerit sidera: sc. ew Aenea,-—“ asks Aeneas about the stars,
their path through the dark night.’' Iter is in loose apposition to
sidera. The genitive opacae noetis corresponds to a pair of attribu-
tive adjectives, “the dark, nocturnal path.” As guiding the voyager
along his way, the stars are themselves called the path.

164, 165. The subjunctives are those of indirect question depending
on the idea of “ saying '' in cantus movete (z canite).

165. pelago: “over the sea.'’ Cp. ΙΧ., 122, pontoque feruntur.
The locative ablative without a preposition is commonly found
when there is included the idea of arten-§ion throuqlc or over· with
verbs of motion, i.e. the road by which. So in v, 102, tremefacta 3020
tellus, “right through to its foundations.'’ Cp. v. 540.

166. princeps: predicat-ive adjective, “was the first· to . . .'' “led
the way and . . . ’'. aerata: the beaks ot ancient vessels were of·
bronze for ramming purposes. Here is meant a gilded figure-head
representing a tiger ; in v. 171 a similar figure-head represents Apollo.

168. quis: archaic dative plural (also ablative), originally instru-
mental. The dative is possessive with erant understood.

169. goryti: “quive1-s,’' a Greek word originally meaning a bow-
case. humeris: locative ablative, ep. v. 5, η.

173. belli: S. G. ξ 276, 2.

175. interpres: a go-between of gods and men, i.e. one who
interprete gods to men.

176. The Etruscans were famous for their skill in divination by
the entrails of victims, the stars (astroloyy), lightning, and the flight
or notes of birds (anyto-y).
