“ lesseuing‘’), which uses a pair of negatives to replace one positive
term, so modifying the bareness of the positive statement. So in
English, ‘³ 1 am not sorry ” = ‘⁴ I am rather glad,'' but not so strong
as the bare “ I am glad.''

496, 497. pondera . . . nefas: another hendiadys, cp. 422, u. The
heavy belt was of metal, embossed with the (story of the) crime ot
the Danaids, the daughters of Danaus, who murdered their husbands,
the fifty sons of Aegyptus, on the eve of their weddings. Only one,
Hypermnestm, spared her husband, Lynceus. Balnea· is a spondee
by synaeresis,

497. nefas: abstract for concrete = “the horrible deed,'' “the
scene of horror.”

502. nescia ε on this depend the genitivesfatss sartis (S. G. ξ 276,
2) by the usual idiom, and also the infinitive servare. Such an
infinitive is an extension of the ordinary prolative infinitive with
verbs, e.g. neseio servare. It was extended to adjectives partly in
imitation os similar Greek idioms (δεινὸς λέγειν, etc.), and is very
commonly so used by Horace3 e.g. indoctus pati, nescius cedere,
audax perpeti. Hence perhaps arose the use wit-h nouns, as in
fiducia praecipere. v. 277.

503. magno: like par-co, v. 494—“a time when he shall have
wished for unharmed Pallas bought at a great price‚” ie.. ‘⁶ with that
he could buy Pallas' safety?⁷ The time comes in Aen. XII.. 940,
when Aeneas’ inclination to spare Turnus is checked by the sight ot
Pallas' belt, which the latter was wearing. Intactas Pallas = “the
safety of Pallas,'' just, as urbs capta may mean “the capture of the
city, ⁷’ especially in phrases like pos-t vrbem captam, etc.

504. ista: as if Vergil were addressing (1) his readers, “these
spoils which you see,'' or (2) Turnus, “ those spoils of thine.”

506. frequentes: “in crowds.'’ The word rai-ely means “frequent‘’

509. cum: with the indicative = “at the time wheu,” ie. “while
nevertheless thou leavest.”

511. tenui discrimine: “are in a narrow breach in respect ot*
death,” wne. “ are but ahand‘s breadth removed from death ; ” descriptive
ablative. Disermen (from (lis-cerno) properly means “adivision,” and
hence “ that which divides ;” so discrimen lete& = ‘⁴ the space which
divides one from death.'’ The accus. and infin. (esse) depends upon
the action of reporting in (luctor. &zemwrere is constructed with
tempus (esse) as in the example quoted on v. 277.

513. proxima quaeque: “whatever is near.'' Quisque, coupled
with a superlative, regularly takes the place of our English “all ’'
with au adjective. It is more usual in the singular than the plural,
e.g. optimus qui-eque = “ all good men.’⁷

514. limitem: “drives a line ” of slaughtered warriors, eze. leaves
it to mark his track.

516. mensae: as described in VIII„ 182.
