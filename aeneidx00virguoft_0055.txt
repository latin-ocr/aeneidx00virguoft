80. Notice the emphatic positions of the contrasted words, paoem
and arma. The first and last words of a hexameter line are those
most emphasised when emphasis is desired.

81. Graium : genitive plural, cp. v. 2, n. Graii is another name
for the collective Greeks, like Danae? ,· Aryohoi, Achivi, and Pelasqi
rather specify particular sections of the whole people.

82. pro: “instead of.’' It was thus she brought Aeneas out of
Troy.

83. Cf. IX., vv. 107—122, and X„ vv. 220—223. Nymphas here =
Nereidas, ‘⁴ sea-nymphs.'’

85. absit: jussive subjunctive : “let him stay away.”

88. fluxas: “ wavering.” Notice the past active participle from
the intransitive flua, as if from a deponent fluor. tibi is ethic dative.

89. The allusion is to Venus’ action in prompting Parisvto carry off
Helen. Cf. Introd.‚ ξ 3.

90. consurgere: instead of this use of the infinitive as a genitive
verbal noun with eausa, cm· consmyerent would be found in prose.
Cp. IX., 12, Nune tempu-s· equos, mmo poscere currus.

92. adulter: Paris. Cf. Introd., ξ 3.

96. orabat: ‘⁴ pleaded,'' delivered her oratio.

98. silvis: locative ablative, Cp. v, 5, n. Besides its merely
privative sense of “blind‚'' caecus means, sometimes, “causing

“ difficult to understand.’'

The verb is only used in this form.

102. solo : like silvi-9, v. 98-66 in its foundations.''

103. posuere: intransitive. This use of pono is rare3 but cp. V.

Georg. Ι.. 330, terra tremit, fugere serae. placida: proleptic——“to
calmness; ’² cp. v. 232, n.

104. animis: may be taken as an instrumental ablative, or as

see note, Uoc, edition. The locative is perhaps best.

107. secat spem: this is an archaism3 secat comes from the old
word seco = sequor, from which comes sector, sectio, secta. Seco,
Ι cut, is quite a different word.

108. “I will make no distinction whether he be Trojan or
Rutulian.” Fuat is an old present subjunctive, formed from the root

use of -ne instead of an with the second alternative is not uncommon, ἱ
especially if no particle is used with the first. ¹

110. Troiae: i.e. Τνοίαηυνίιηι.
