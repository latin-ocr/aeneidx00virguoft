Greece was probably undertaken for the sake of his health,
and the same reasons may have prompted his choice of
a residence near Naples3 near which town he was buried,
with the following epitaph inscribed above him :—

Parthenope : cecini pascua, rura, duces. ⁷³

ξ 2. The earliest works of Vergil were possibly some or
all of the minor pieces known as the Culex (Gnat), Ciris,
Moretum (Salacl), Copa (Hostess); but the
authenticity of all these is open to question.
His fame as a poet began with the publication, prior to
Β.0. 35, of the Ecloyae or Bucolica, ten brief poems,
imitating the pastoral poetry of Theocritus the Syracusan
<3rd cent. B.C.) Like all the great works of Vergil, these
are written in hexameters, and it was the smoothness of
the versification and the novelty of the subject which gained
them their popularity. Vergil loved the country, and
Maecenas made use of his taste to persuade him to write
a long didactic poem on Agriculture——the Georyics—which
describes in four books the management of crops, of trees
and vines, of cattle and hores and of bees. Didactic
poetry is such as conveys sy stematic instruction in the
form of verse· and while the Geor( {sies are so poetical as to
rank for beauty as highly perhaps as any Latin poetry,
they were consideied 1111111110 guides to the pursuits of
which they treated Maecenas persuaded the poet to
undertake this task 111 ordei to please Augustus, who was
endeavouring to restore the old industry, virtues, and
rural life of Italy, and required a fit poet to glorify
husbandry. Vergil’s model 11010 was Hesiod of Asci· a

But the fame of Vergil rests upon his crowning work, the
Aeneid, an epic of nearly ten thousand lines. It was
long before he could be prevailed upon to undertake the
poem, and when he died he had already been engaged upon
it for ten years. Augustus had wished a poem Oto immor—
