nores. 39

290. per remos alii: a verb must be supplied from the sense of the
previous context, e.g. eoepositi sunt. They either slid down them
(per = along), or merely made use of them (per = by means of), as
buoys iu the waves.

291. spirant : the mood shows that the clause is merely adjectiva1‚
not an indirect question depending on speculatus. Spin-ant expresses
the “ soughing '² of the waves as well as their rise and fall, like the
bosom of one breathing.

292. inoffensum : passive ; “ not struck upon anything.”

295. tollite, ferte ε the notion is that of making the vessel leap and
rise under the force of the oars.

297. frangere : another instance of the free use of the infinitive.
Cp. v. 10, n„ and v. 119, n. Here it takes the place of an object-
accusative. In prose recuso often takes a subjunctive clause with
quin, quom-inus, or ne.

301. siecum: cp. v. 251, n. The tenses in this line require
attention.

302. innocuae ε “ unharmed.'‘ In prosc the word is active =“ doing
no harm.'' Cp. the double use of infestus and penetrabilis.

303. iniquo ε “cruel.'’ The word is the negative of aecus in the
three senses of (1) level ; (2) just, fair ς (3) kind. Dorsum, a ·'‘ back,”
hence a “ridge.'’

305. solvitur : ‘⁶ breaks up.’' in undis (not in undas), simply
shows place where.

306. transtra ε cross-benches on which the rowers sat.

310. canunt: “the trumpets sound.'‘ The common usage is in
the phrase receptui canere, “to give the signal for retreat ” where
the subject (eg. siqnum or tubicen) is not expressed. Siqua is nomi-
native. Cp. Livy, XXVII„ 15, canere inde tubae.

311. omen pugnae: “a forecast of the fight.” A similar phrase
occurs ix. 53, principium pugnae, in a similar construction. In each
instance the noun is in loose apposition with the entire clause to
which it is coupled. The ‘⁴ forecast ’⁷ was not Aeneas in person, but
the manner in which he rushed to the fight. Cp. VI„ 222, Pars
‘e'nqenti subiere feretro, triste 7722‘72i3tere'um, “ A part put their shoulders
to the huge bier: a sad office.”

312. virum: cp. v. 2, n. Ultro is used just as inv, 2·78—“ without
waiting to be first attacked.”

313. huie: possessive dative. perque . . . per: the repetition of
per is regarded as a kind of copula. Cp. VH„ 327. “Odit et ipse
pater Pluton, odere sorores Tartareae monstrum.''

317. Cissea : Greek accusative, like Rhoetea, v. 399, from nomina-
tive in -eua

318. Gyan: accus. of Gyas, like Aenean. olava : v. 218, π.

319. leto ι prose would require acl letum instead of the dative, un-
less leto be taken as an ablative of the means. The first explanation
is the more probable on the analogy of demiserit Oreo, etc. Vergil
makes free use of the dative for the accusative with preposition‚
regarding it rather as a kind of indirect object than as the goal ot*
