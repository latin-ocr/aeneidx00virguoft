No'rEs. 3 7

like ex oecultmpm· tacitum. Adjectives of less than three terminations
are rarely so used.

252. parens: Cybele; q.v., Index. cordi: commonly explained as
a predicative dative from ουν (dative of result. S. G. ἓ 297), likesmtqi,
fraudi ; and hence used like an indeclinable adjective. It may,
however, have been originally a locative form analogous to heri,
domi, etc.

253. ad frena leones: “broken to the bit.’' The prepositional
phrase is virtually equivalent to an adjective, as in the expression
servos ad cyathos = “a cup-bearer,” libertus acl epistolas ε “a
secreta .''

254. 1'gog-nae princeps : “be my leader in the fight.'' The impera·
tive is to be supplied from the jussive subjunctives (S. G. ξ 444)
which follow, propinques: the verb is naturally intransitive, but
cp. the use of ruvo.

255. secundo: “favourable.’' The word is a gerundive which has
lost its gerundival force, and survives only as an adjective from
sequor, to follow; and hence it means (1) following3 and so (2)
favourab1e3 or (3) next, second. For the form compare volt-endas,
“rolling’‘; blandus, “kindly”; oriundus, “springingss’ etc.

256. revoluta: observe that die-s· is here feminine. The rule is that
in the singular it is feminine when meaning an appointed day, and
almost always when it means time, period (ψ’ time, as in the English
“a day will come.” “

257. fugarat: cp. v. 244, n.

258. sequantur: jussive subj., indirect, the direct form being
sequimini. There is no ellipse of nt, for edicit sequantur differs from
edicit ¹w} sequantur just as ‘⁶ Ι bid you go '’ differs from ‘⁶ 1 order you
to g0.’' In the former case the subj. is a command, in the latter it is
to be classed as final, and the clause takes the place of an object.
The same applies to aptent, parent. Cp. vv. 54, m, 443, 525.

261. deinde: used here to strengthen eum, as in the common phrase
tum deiude.

264. quales ι the connection is loose, and the comparison general,
not particular. The Trojans do not hurl their arrows like cranes, but
their voices sound like those of cranes migrating, extraordinarily far-
reaching.

265. Strymoniae: from the river Strymon, in the south-west corner
of Thrace, the boundary between that country and Macedonia. The
gender of [frus is common. aethera: Greek acc., S. G. ξ 40.
Cp. aiira, thoraca (v. 337), lampada, cratera, and many proper names,
such as Pallanta,

266. secundo: ‘⁴ favourable,’' ‘⁴ joyful.'’ See note 011 v, 255.

267. videri: historic infinitive. It can only be used when no stress
is laid upon the time, duration, 01· sequence of things, the infinitive
mood being “ timeless.'’ Hence its use in describing hurried, involved
states or actions.

269. respiciunt: “they look back and see.” adlabi: “the whole
sea gliding in with the fleet.” classibus: cp. v. 191, ιι.
