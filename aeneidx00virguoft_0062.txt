272. liquida: “clean’' A common epithet of the atmosphere.
Cp. liquet, it is clear3 liquescit, it becomes clear. cometae: a
Greek noun declined like geometres, cp. S. G. ξ 18; hence masculine
sanquwae‘b.

273. lugubre: adverbia] accusative. Cp. horrendum stridens ;
‘intonuit laevam ‚· dulce loquens, and sublime volan-s· (v. 664). Sirius :

sslaioris), whose rising heralds the dog days.

274. aegris: either (1) a perpetual epithet3 or (2) proleptic, show·
ing the result of “ille . . . nascitur.’'

275. laevo: ‘⁴ baleful.’' Like sinister, the word has a secondary
meaning ot ·‘ ill-omened‚'’ except when applied technically to Roman
augury, when it signifies ‘³ lucky.”

27 7. praecipere. . . . pellere: either (l) the infinitives are used as
simple substantives in apposition with fiducia, as a kind of analysis
of his confidence—“ his courage, the seizing of the shore, failed him
not ; ” or (2) the construction may be explained as a survival of the
original sense of the infinitive, viz., dative of a verbal noun, denoting
work contemplated—“ courage for occupying the shore.'’ A parallel
usage to (2) 13 tempu-5· (est) lmmn teqere papaver, “it is time to sow

expresses the occurrence of something more than was to be expected
or required. So here—“ of his own accord‚'’ or ‘⁶ in spite of what had
occurred.’⁷ lt may often be rendered “actually‚'’ “even” Its
force is intensified by its position in the emphatic places and its
repetition. (The emphatic places of a hexameter are the beginning

“ praiseworthy deedff Cp. IX., 197, laudum percussus amore,
“smitten with a passion for praiseworthy deeds.'' Α
