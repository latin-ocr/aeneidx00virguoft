NOTES.

 

Nom—S. G. refers to Smith's Smaller Latc'n Grammar. (Murray, 33. δά.)

2. divom: the archaic genitive plural occurs very frequently
throughout the book, especially in the forms virum, socium, in proper
names, eg. Graium, and regularly in patronymics like Aeneadum.
Besides these uses in poetry‚ it is regularly used in prose in the
names of weights and measures and declinable cardinal numerals.
N otice the spelling vo, πο, which is more correct than vu or uu.

4. Dardanidum: fr. Dardanidae (not -e-5) ; see last note.

5. tectis: the abl. of place without a preposition is common in
poetry, but in prose is confined to names of towns and small islands
in consonantal and -i stems⁷ and to a few other w·›rds‚ such as parte,
loeo, Iaera, terra, marique, etc.

6. quianam: quia is either the old instrumental singular (cp. Enss.
why ζ’) or accusative plural (cp. quid ? Ξ zclty ?) of qui, retaining in
this word its interrogative force. The suffix —nam is a merely in-
tensive particle.

7. iniquis: cp. v, 303, n.

9. quis: the rule is that qvi is adjectival, asking the quality ; qui-⁴2
substantival‚ asking the name; but quel? is often, as here, used
adjectivally.

10. sequi . . . lacessere: infinitive‚ in place of the usual vt clause
after verbs of advising. 'l'his use is found in all Latin write1·s; it is
the object infinitive extended to causative verbs on the analogy of
its original use as dative of a verbal noun with such verbs as clare
andfueere. Cp. vv, 119, 366, 439.

11. ne arcessite: in prohibitions with ne, the present imperative is
used only in poets ς the more common use is the perfect subjunctive,
01· a periphrasis with nale: or eave. Cp. v. 372, η.

12. 'l‘he allusion is to the 2nd Punic War, 218—202 B.C.‚ when
Hannibal crossed the Alps from Spain, and within the first three
years almost overthrew Rome. ‘⁴ Shall throw the opened Alps on
Rome ” is a short way of saying, ‘⁴ Shall cross them and throw himself
