INTRODUCTION. xi

building a city, Carthage. The queen welcomes Aeneas
graciously, being tricked by Venus 3 and over a banquet
which she provides, Dido asks to hear the tale of Troy’s fall.
This ends Book I.

Book II. contains the narrative already given of the
wooden horse, the sack of Troy, and the hair-breadth
escape of Aeneas with the loss of his wife Creusa 3 and the
tale continues in Book III., wherein are described the various
fruitless attempts of the fugitives to settle in Thrace,
Epirus, and Sicily, and the death of Anchises.

Book IV. contains the story of Dido's passion for Aeneas,
his marriage with her, and his speedy departure at the
bidding of the gods, who refused to allow him to settle
elsewhere than in Italy. In despair the queen commits
suicide.

In Book V. we have a long description of the games
celebrated at Eryx in Sicily, the colony of AcesteS, another
Trojan refugee, in honour of the dead Anchises. The boat
race, foot racc, boxing, wrestling, and shooting matches are
all described in detail, and the book closes with the ultimate
arrival of Aeneas in Italy.

Book VI. is filled with another episode which, like that
of Dido's love, serves to relieve the monotony of 1116 long -
poem. Aeneas, guided by the Cumaean Sibyl, descends to
the under-world by the way of AvernUS, and there meets
and converses with the spirits of dead heroes, and with other
spirits as yet not embodied, who are one day to 11176 and act
as kings or generals of Rome. He meets also his father
Anchises, who unfolds 10 him all the future glory of Rome.
The book thus becomes a magnificent prophecy, foretelling
the wars and triumphs of Rome up to Actium, B.o. 31.

Τ116 real activity of the poem commences in Book VII.
Landing in Italy, Aeneas finds himself welcomed by Latinus,
king of the Latins. His daughter Lavinia is already
betrothed to Turnus, prince of the Rutulians of Ardea,
but he now pledges her to Aeneas. J uno sees her oppor-
tunity to crush the Trojans finally, and sends the fin-y
Allecto to stir up Turnus to avenge himself by arms. He
rouses the nations of Italy, and an accident sets the two .
parties 61 strife.
