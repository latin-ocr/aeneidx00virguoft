36 AENElD X.

223. ad litora: “hard by the beach.'' Simple place at is expressed
by in, while ad signifies “in the direction of,'’ or ‘⁵ near‚’' ot presence
after motion.

224. lustrant: “go around.’' The primary meaning of the word
seems to be “to purity by xvalking round with solemn services?
Hence we get the double meaning “ to go round,” whether physically
or mentally, and ‘⁶ to worship.”

225. fandi: genitive of relation, expressing that ‘in point of which
an epithet is applied (poetic). S. G. ξ 285.

226. dorso: ablative ot measure. S. G. ᾗ 321.

228. deum gens: “offspring of the gods‚’' an unusual sense of

ens.
‘q 230. They had been ships (v. 206, n.) of pine wood. Idaeae : with
pinus> by hypallage or t-ransference of epithet from certifie.

231. pelagi: remember that pelas] 118 is· ot' neuter gender, and
forms (Greek plural) pelaqe (nom. and accus. only).

232. praecipitis: “was driving us headlong.” Notice the proleptic
use of the adjective, i.e. it is expressive of the result of the verb's
action. Cp. v. 103, premitpla-eida aequora· pontus,

235. deas ε the more usual syntax would be the dative dedit (uobis)
esse (leia Cp. IX„ 92, prosit nostris in montibus ortas (esse).

237. Marte: ‘⁵ War.’' Such personifications are common. Cp.
I'emts = love, Bacchus = wine, Ceres = corn, Volcanus = fire,
vapiter = the sky, ,llinerva = wit.

238. loca: ‘·' position.'' The neuter form of the plural of loeus
usually signifies “connected spots‚” ile. “regions;’' the masculine
form signifies “separate spots‚” eff. passages in books. The distinc-
tion is not, however, essential.

239. Arcas eques: “the Arcadian horsemen.” Like pedes and
miles, eques is commonly used as a collective noun. No mention has
been made of this cavalry by Vergil ; we must suppose they had been
sent by Euander the Arcadian to support the Trojans.

240. iungant: intransitive, equivalent to immane se. Vergil uses
in a similar way many verbs commonly transitive, ezg. pono (v. 103),
tendo, wis-ceo, praecipito.

243. Ignipotens: Vulcan, the god of fire. oras: ‘⁶ edges'’ The
word ora originally meant the “ extremity '⁷ of anything ; hence the
edge of the land, ‘² the shore‚'' and oras belli, “ the end of the πει-ξ’
its “issue’'

244. putaris: :putarem-3. Cp.suqa7·at (v. 257).

247. modi: “ well knovving the way⁷’ to do sc. The genitive is
the object of the action impliedin the adjective ἰρηανα. Substantivcs
and adjectives are used in this way with the genitive, just as transi-
tive verbs are used with an accusative. See S. G. ξ 276, 2.

250. Anchisiades: S. G. ξ 179 (i) 3. Aeneas is meant.

251. supera convexa: “the vault above.” The use of the neuter
adjective as a substantive is exceedingly common in Vergil and Livy,
though less frequent in earlier Latin. Cp. alta (of sky or sea), pro·
fundum, siceum, etc., and a large number of prepositional phrases
