178. acie: this ablative falls under the general heading of instru-
mental; cp. the ablative with expressions of plenty and want, S. G.
ἓ 180. Etrusca solo: ‘⁴ Tuscan by its position, but originally from
Alpheus.'’ IndeX, av. Pisae.

183. Caerete domo : “who are from Caere, their home.’' Ablative
of origin, or of place whence. S. G. ἐξ 261, 310. Caere is more

186. transierim: the (potential) subjunctive of mild assertion‚ in

instrument or means rather than as an agent, which would be
expressed by ιι [Μυσίδ’. It is not dative of the agent (S. G. ξ 293),

the many deponent verbs of which the past participles may have
a passive sense (S. G. ξ 525).

188. The line is “the most obscure in Vergil,'’ and cannot be
explained because we do not know the legend. Erat must be sup-

vocative and ‘cestrum as applying to amor (= Cupid and his
mother), ‘⁶ the swan's feathers are a reproach‚ O Love, to thee and
thy mother, and the blazon of thy father's form.’'

qresszoe, etc. Aequales are those who are one's equals in age.
