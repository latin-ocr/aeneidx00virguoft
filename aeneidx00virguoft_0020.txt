xvi INTRODUCTION.

since an elided syllable does not count in scansion. Two
examples occur in Book X. :—

Sternitsir Ι infe-l Ι ix asi Ι e‘no Ι volnere, Ι co‘elTimque
Aspicit Ι (x. 781—782).

Csambr’ Ι ὦσε-[κά Ι unt odel Ι Hm Tro Ι {sque La‘t Ι {nique
ᾸᾱνὸΙΞπ ζ Αῐηέ Ι εἷς . . . . (x. 895—896).

where, in each case, -qzce disappears before initial A. This
is called ›S'ynccloeplza (συναλείφω). Thjs Synaloepha between
the end of one line and the beginning of the next is not
regular, each line, except in very rare cases, being
regarded as a separate unit for metrioal purposes (op. x.
12—13, 25—26 .

The fifth foo)t is regularly a daotyl. A spondee only
occurs in this foot for the sake of special rhythmio effect.

In each verse should ooour a Ooesura, that is, a pause in
the sound, due to the ending of one word and the commence-
ment of the next in the middle of a metrical foot. Ea„
in the first example quoted there is a coesura between the
words infelix and alieno.

When ooourring at the end of the first syllable of the
foot, the caesura is known as strong or male 3 when ooourring
at the end of the second syllable in a dactylio foot, it is
known as weak or female.

Very rarely is there no mesura,- sometimes it is found
in the 4th foot (eff, X. 822), but its proper position is as a
male caesurco in the 3rd foot.

(b) Prosody.-—XVith regard to rules for the quantity of
syllables, the following are the most important, but they
are nearly all subject to exoeptions :—

(1) A diphthong or contracted syllable is long, e.g. c't‘z‘weps,
0697315 (= οόἶςχὶί).

(2) The former of two vowels not forming a diphthong is
short, e.g. ymerius.

(3) A vowel is long when it is followed (1) by two con-
sonants or x or z, whether in the same word or different
words 3 or (2) by semi-consonant i (sometimes printed j) in
the same word.
