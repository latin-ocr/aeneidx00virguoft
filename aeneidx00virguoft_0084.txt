Latinus, -i. m. : king of Laurentum, father of Lavinia, and husband
of Amata. His subjects are usually called Aboriqmes, but from him
they took the name of Latins. His treatment of his affianced son-
in-law Turnus gave rise to the war with Aeneas. From him came
the name of the Latini. See mn Latium, and Introd.‚ ξ 4.

Latium, -ii, n. : the country of the Lat-ini, lying on the west coast
of Italy, between the Tiber and the Sabines on the north, the Marsi
and Samnium on the east, Campania on the south-east, and the sea.
In the time of the kings this region was divided amongst several
small tribes, such as the Aequi, Hernici, Volsci, and the Prisci Latini,
Aborigines, or Old Latins, named after the mythical King Latinus
of Laurentum (see Introd.‚ ξ 4). The latter then occupied thirty cities
in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, chief amongst which was
Alba Longa. After Alba was rased by Tullus Hostilius, the Latini
were gradually reduced by successive kings, until the expulsion of
Tarquin the Arrogant gave them the opportunity of throwing off the
yoke of Rome. They were finally conquered at the close ot the Latin
War, 338 B.c., and many ot their towns received the full eit-itas, or
franchise, of Rome. The remainder became allied towns (svs-ii), with
certain special privileges, and were known as the AVomen Latinum, in
which, however, were included many other colonies of Rome outside
Latium.
