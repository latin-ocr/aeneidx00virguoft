nores. 41

corpore ε fido occasionally takes an ablative (causal) instead of the
more usual dative. Cp. v. 181, η.

350. Threicios: Boreas, god of the North Wind, was fabled to
dwell amongst the mountains of Thrace, one of which was Ismarus
(also the name of a lake and town at its base). The adjectives
from Thracia or Thrace are (1) Threicius,- (2) Threicius ,· (3)
Thra-r.

353. The Aurunci dwelt in the valley of the Liris, in Campania,
and are possibly identical with the Ausonii.

355. certatur: “the fight was fought.'' Intransitive verbs admit
only of an impersonal passive. Cp. itur, ventum est, v. 710.

357. animis: the winds are personified‚ and hence they are spoken
of as having ·'‘ courage‘' and ‘⁴ strength.⁷’

361. “Close pressed, stands foot by foot and man by man.’' The
case of pede and viro is probably ablative (locative); cp. mucrone
induat, v. 681; corpore- itehaerez‘, v. 8453 and other writers use haer-eo
with an ablative. On the other hand pede may =J]e(li, and be an
instance of archaism. Cp. triumm're' aere flando feriavmlo, where
aere is distinctly a dative of work contemplated.

362. rotantia : here intransitive. So Vergil uses pascentes (agnos)
= “ grazing ; ” volventes =²⁶ whirling (volventibus annis).” For other
verbs so used see v. 240, -η,

363. ripis : “from the banks‚’' ablative of motion from with
diruta.

364. Arcadas ε S. G. ξ 40. They were cavalry (v. 239), and hence
unaccustomed to fighting as infantry.

365. Latio: ‘⁴ to the Latins.’' Abstract for concrete ; cp. senectam
= “ grey hairs,” v. 192 3 volnera = ⁴³ wounds,’' v. 140.

366. qast-:quibam v. 168, η. dimittere: see on v. 10. Quando
here=quando quidem, “since'’ Notice the double relative. Such
a sentence as “which whoso says’' is very common in Greek, and
not rare in Latin ; e.g. quihus qui utantur. In modern English the
double relatives are replaced by two demonstrativos : “ and they who
use these things.” So with quae eum, quae ubi. etc.

367. unum quod: “the one thing which was left.'’ The relative
refers to the following line.

369. per ‘vos : either (l) ·'‘ by yourselves and your brave deeds,” cp.
v. 597, n. ; or (2) the ros does not belong to the preposition (which
governsfaeta—nomen—bella—spem), but is the object after a (sup-
pressed) verb of adjuring. The construction is a Graecism, and an
exact parallel occurs Aen„ IV„ 314, per eqo has lam-ymas delirumque
tua-m. te . . . miserere domu-5· labenti-e, “By these tcars and thy
right hand I entreat thee pity a falling house.'’ Cp. the phmse pet· te
deos oro. et must here be treated as the first in a series of con-
junctions, and either rendered ‘⁴ both‚³⁷ or omitted in translating.

372. fidite ne: the mood and the inversion of the order are alike
inadmissible in prose, which employs the subjunctive for prohibitions
in the second person, and frequently for other persons also, the usual
tense being the perfect (cp. v. 11, ne arersse'z‘e).
