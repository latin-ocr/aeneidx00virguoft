779. Argis: Argos (in Latin more frequently Argi, nom. pl), the
capital of Argolis in the Peloponnese. It was but a few miles south-

Subsequent importance quite ruined Mycenae.

initial vowel of the next, by synaloepha. See Introduction, ξ 8 ; and
c . IX. 650.

Ρ782. Argos : φ·(’))ιῖ]ιί.ςουν here takes the accusative. The distinction
between the case-usages of verbs of remembering is commonly said
to be that with the accusative they imply a more lasting state, with
the genitive a momentary fact.

784. cavom, ete. : the shield was circular (orbem). and >concavet

791. casum: this, and the other accusatives, are the objects to
silebo, which, like taceo, is often useel as a transitive verb.

794. inque ligatus ; by tmesis (τμῆσις, “ cutting '') for et ‘inliqatmsn
Such a license is rare in Vergil, but another example occurs in IX„
288, inque salutatam. It is common in Lueretius and the older poets,
usually iu the case of dissyllabic prepositions, and Ennius even has
cere-hrum. In Homeric Greek the preposition is constantly separated
from its verb. In one Latin verb, super-vum, the preposition re-
mained separable even in prose to the latest times.

795. inimicum hastile: i.e. hastile minaei.

7 99. sustinuit : ‘⁴ stayed him.’' magno elamore : ablative of
