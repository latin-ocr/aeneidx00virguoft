50 AENEID x.

participles must end in -um in hexameter verses except where there
occurs elision of the final m (eelctltlipsds). So we have venantmu,
sonantum, balantum, ete.

67 5. ago : the present indicative is often used in questions relating
to the speaker’s present or prospective action = “ What am Ι doing? ⁷'
or “ on the point of doing C? '' dehiscat : potentia] subjunctive.
C . v. 19, n.

p678. Syrtis : gen. sing. The name is more usually found in the
plural, Syrtes. lt was the name of the great bays on the north coast
of Africa, eastward of Tunis, which abound in quicksands, and means
“the drifts.’' Hence, generally, “a quicksand.’'

679. sequatur : subjunctive after quo final (= ut eo). S. G. §478

681, 682. mucrone induat : dubitative subjunctive. The phrase is
an inversion of the usual induo me veste, and means to “ wrap oneselt'
about one's sword,'' πλε. “ to fall upon it.''

681, 683. an induat . . . an iaciat: an . . . an cannot stand for
utrum . . . an, but the usage is an extension of that in which an
occurs in apparently single questions, the first alternative being
unexpressed (S. G. ξ 415).

686. animi : locative, like domi, belli, humi, etc., “ pitying the
warrior in her heart.'' Animi is so used with verbS, e.g. anqorfflendeo,
and with adjectiveS, e.g. aeger, fideus, inteqer. The main objection
to classing this usage with that mentioned in S. G. ξ 285 (genitive of
respect) is that the latter is only found in comparatively late writers,
while animi pendeo occurs in the earliest.

688. urbem : Ardea. See Index, av. Turnus.

692. viro: objective dative after imitant. The repetition of uni
is an artificial trick to express excitement or intense feeling.

694. exposta : = esc-posita, by syncope (a term applied to the
omission of a vowel in the middle of a word) of the third syllable.
So imposta, reposta, periclum, saeelum, etc.

697. humi : one of the few instances of the survival of the locative
ease as such in Latin. That case originally ended in -ἴ, which in the
0- stems became oi, passing to ῐ by coalition with the stem vowel 0.
In the i· stems it was confused with the ablative, and ἱ was regarded
as the proper locative ending in Latin (hence humi, ruri, domi, etc.)‚
except in the first declension, where traces still remain of the old
true locative form, e.g. Romae z Roma-i. cum quo : Cicelo prefers
the enclitic -c-um with the ablative of the relative and personal
pronouns, e.g. quocum (or quic-um), meeum, etc.

699. occupat : cp. v. 384, n. Clhe direct object of the verb is
Latayum, but this is made more particular by the addition of the
further explanatory accusatives σε· faciemque. Such a ti gure is called
that of ‘⁴ the whole and part,'' and is very common in Homeric verse;
the second accusatives are often called accusatives of nearer definition.
Cp. XII„ 276, unum tramadiqit costa-s.

701. donat habero: so in IX„ 362 we have dat habere nepoti.
The infinitive in such expressions is called epexegetic (explanatory),
prolative, or complementary. It may be a relic of the original sense
