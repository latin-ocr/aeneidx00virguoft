653. coniuncta: “moored to the edge of a lofty cliff.” Orepz'do

κρηπίς, a rising bank or elevation ; crepido ,ςἰιαί· probably means
‘·' a projecting rock.’' Coniunyo usually takes a dative or the ablative
with eum ; occasionally the ablative alone, like haereo.

654. scalis . . . ponte: two ways of expressing the same thing3 a
ladder which served as a bridge to the land. Cp. v. 658.

655. Clusinis : ‘⁶ of Clusium,” for which see Index,

657. conicit ε cp. v, 330, n. segnior : predicative.

658. moras . . . pontis ε “the barrier of the bridge,” the two
nouns being co-ordinated in syntax just as in v. 654. For this sense
of mora, cp. v. 485. Pontis is here used in the plural by a common
Vergilian usage which thus expresses a eompleoe thing, one consisting
of a plurality of parts,

as analogous to that which follows Greek privative adjectu-es, (aq.
ἄγευστος κακῶν.

668. tanton’ ς i.e. tantone. The ellipse of short final e was common
in Latin. Cp. audin? (= andnam), ain ,7 (= aisne ?), nen and seu

670. quem : for qualem, “in what sort 2 ’⁹ With the reading of the

rare; it is repeated from v. 671, and it converts the relative clause
into a fresh question, the irregularity indicating the speaker's ex-

morte must be taken as a poetical ablative of place, “in the grip of
an unspeakable death.'’
