adjectives take, in poets and later writers, an objective genitive.

Patiens periclum = a man who is enduring peril 3 patiens persida·
= a man able to endure peril. Cp. S. G. ξ 276 (end).
611. submissa: “humblyss’ English uses the adverb3 but in

Latin the adjective is often preferred, particularly when referring to
emotional states.

613. si . . . foret : with the punctuation 01 the text, si . . . foret
is the protasiS‚ and nnn . neyares‘ the apodosis 01 3 conditional
sentence 01 the form 01 that explained in v. 327, η. Namque has
then the unusual sense 01 “surely,’' for which there is no parallel,
although enim is so used, and nempe (with which navique is connected,
and whose meaning may here be archaically imitated) regularly has
this sense. If, however, with some editors, we put a note 01 excla-
mation afterforet, si then introduces a wish ; cp. O milei praeteritos
referat si Iuppiter annas! This is really a case 01 ellipse of the
apodosis, which would be something like “it would be well.”
Namque (“for ⁹) is then somewhat out 01 its regular place, as it
occasionally is in Vergil.

615. pugnae : S. G. ξ 292, Obs. 2.

619. Pilumnus: father 01 Venilia, and (as in v. 76) grandfather
01 Turnus. Quartus pater is a synonym for ahaz-as, “great-great-
grandfather,” Vergil here apparently following some other version
01 the legend.

623. meque hoe : ‘⁵ And 11 thou understandest that this is my will,’'
vle. 11 it be understood that only a respite is allowed, not entire
escape.

625. indulsisse vacat: “there is room for me to have thus far
indulged you,'' 226. “ I may grant you this much.'’ The perfect tense
is used because the action is viewed as already accomplished. Vacat
is impersonal.

626. venia : concrete, “act of grace.” The English word “ favour’'
has the same abstract and concrete sense as venia.

628. gravaris: “which you grant so grudgingly in speech,” lit.
“in regard to which you are annoyed in speech.” Quod is an accu-
sative 01 limitation, such as regularly goes with verbs of emotion,
qaudeo, laetor, etc. Hence arose the use 01 quod = because3 e.g.
gaudeo (id) quod ades = “ I am pleased because you are here ’² (lit.
“as to your being here’⁷).

630. manet : with an accusative maneo = “ to await; ” with a dative
it = ‘⁵ to be reserved for.'' veri: for the genitive, see v. 326, η.

632. ludar: ut introducing a wish is poetical3 the prose form'
is utinam, and it is regularly followed by the optative subjunctive,
or subjunctive 01 wish. Cp. S. G. ξ 444.

637. in faeiem: ‘³ equips with Dardan weapons into the guise of
Aeneas,'' zle. “so as to represent Aeneas.‘’ In with the accusative
ordinarily represents motion, and gives here the picture 01 the trans-
formation in its process, visu ε S. G. ξ 544.

641. qualis : the antecedent (talem fiqzcram) is suppressed, as often
in the case 01 correlatives. In the next line the 11111 construction would
