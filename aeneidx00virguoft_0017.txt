Book XII. finds Turnus challenging Aeneas to fight single-
handed for Lavinia. A treaty is made and sworn, but
J uno contrives to get it broken, and in the battle which at
once ensues Aeneas is wounded. Venus cures him and
sends him back refreshed to meet Turnus, who is now

care to show how Julius, Augustus' grand-uncle, was
descended from Iulus the son of Aeneas and grandson of
a goddess. The triumph of Augustus was described as the
necessary and inevitable working out of a long-hidden des-

one whose title came from heaven. Vergil was induced to
commence his great epic by the request of the Emperor
